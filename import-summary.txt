ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.

                                                                      -   

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* game_image\
* game_image\boat2.png
* game_image\boat3.png
* game_image\boat4.png
* game_image\boat5.png
* game_image\images0IQU45T7.jpg
* game_image\images9J8H7NQG.jpg
* game_image\imagesEBY1X6Y4.jpg
* game_image\imagesEXCB4ZUC.jpg
* game_image\imagesPI3EOHWB.jpg
* game_image\imagesSCQPP11R.jpg
* game_image\imagesU5HHO448.jpg
* game_image\load-back.png
* game_image\people1.png
* game_image\people2.png
* game_image\tube1.png
* game_image\wave2.jpg
* game_image\wave3.jpg
* game_image\wave4.png
* game_image\wave5.png
* game_image\wave6.png
* game_image\침몰1.jpg
* game_image\침몰2.png

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
